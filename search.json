    "section": "",
    "text": "The Nebraska soccer program has been a consistent force since its first season in 1995. Over several years, players have gone on to be professional and highly respected athletes.\nTwo well-known standouts developed within the program are Haley Hanson and Caroline Flynn. Hanson left her mark on the university with several accolades, including being named a Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week, on the Big Ten Preseason Honors List and a participant in the U.S. U-23 Women’s National Team Training Camp. She is currently playing professionally in the NWSL with the Orlando Pride, earning a championship with the team last year in 2024.\nCaroline Flynn, distinguished herself during her college years. In 2013, Caroline won the Big Ten regular season and tournament alongside her teammates. During her first season in 2012, she started 18 out of 20 games and upon graduation, Caroline’s accomplishments extended to being drafted as the 40th overall pick in the NWSL.\nAre Caroline and Haley among the best soccer players to emerge from the Nebraska soccer program?

Caroline Flynn is listed right underneath notable players, like retired professionals Jaycie Johnson (Ackerman) and Sydney Miramontez. Caroline Flynn averaged .29 goals and assists per game, followed by Haley Hanson with around .20 goals and assists per game.\nCaroline and Haley were strong competitors and leaders in college athletics, but to list them as some of the best players in the Big Ten is open to interpretation. Caroline retired shortly after her professional debut for Kansas City FC in 2017. This season, Haley’s team, the Orlando Pride, fell short in the NWSL Championship semi-finals."

This could be due to several factors such as the traffic, the retirement of notable players such as Alex Morgan at the end of the 2024 season, etc.\nOther teams with a decrease in attendance include the Utah Royals and Racing Louisville. The factors behind the decline are endless, as the Royals underwent a coaching change within the past year and Racing Louisville, is still working to find its footing, with 2025 marking its fourth season in the league.\nDespite these challenges, the teams continue to defy the statistics against them while having large and supported fan bases.\n\n\nCode\nnwslfirst &lt;- read_csv(\"2024 NWSL Stats - Sheet1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2024)\nnwslsecond &lt;- read_csv(\"2025 NWSL Stats - Sheet1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season = 2025)\nnwsll &lt;- bind_rows (nwslfirst, nwslsecond)\n\n\npride &lt;- nwslfirst |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Squad == \"Pride\"\n  )\n\n\npridebar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nwslfirst, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Pts), weight=Pts)) +\n  geom_bar(data=pride, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Pts), weight=Pts), fill=\"#633492\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Number of Points in the 2024 Season\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\ngotham &lt;- nwslsecond |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Squad == \"Gotham FC\"\n  )\n\n\n\ngothambar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nwslsecond, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Pts), weight=Pts)) +\n  geom_bar(data=gotham, aes(x=reorder(Squad, Pts), weight=Pts), fill=\"#9ADBE8\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Number of Points in the 2025 Season\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\npridebar + gothambar + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Difference in NWSL Champions\",\n    subtitle = \"Orlando Pride was projected to win the 2024 Championship which they did, however \\nnobody could have predicted the eighth seed Gotham to win in 2025.\",\n    caption = \"Source: NWSL | By: Alana Textor\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear contrast between the 2024 and 2025 NWSL Champions.\nIn 2024, many predicted that the Orlando Pride would win the Championship.
