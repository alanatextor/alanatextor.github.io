    "text": "The Nebraska soccer program has been a consistent force since its first season in 1995. Over several years, players have gone on to be professional and highly respected athletes.\nTwo well-known standouts developed within the program are Haley Hanson and Caroline Flynn. Hanson left her mark on the university with several accolades, including being a Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week, Big Ten Preseason Honors List and a participant in the U.S. U-23 Women’s National Team Training Camp. She is currently playing professionally in the NWSL with the Orlando Pride, earning a championship with the team last year in 2024.\nCaroline Flynn, distinguished herself during her college years. In 2013, Caroline won the Big Ten regular season and tournament alongside her teammates. During her first season in 2012, she started 18 out of 20 games and upon graduation, Caroline’s accomplishments extended to being drafted as the 40th overall pick in the NWSL.\nAre Caroline and Haley among the best soccer players to emerge from the Nebraska soccer program?

However, Hanson was injured during the season and was able to score more goals than most. Flynn scored five goals tied with seven other players in the Big Ten and led the Huskers in goals.\n\n\nCode\nstarted &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_soccer_playerstats_2015.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(Player != \"Totals\") |&gt; mutate(PlayerTeam = paste(Player, Team)) |&gt; mutate(GS = as.numeric(GS))\n\ngamesstarted &lt;- started |&gt; \n  filter(Team\n    %in% c(\"Nebraska Huskers\", \n          \"Illinois Fighting Illini\", \n         \"Indiana Hoosiers\", \n         \"Iowa Hawkeyes\", \n          \"Maryland Terrapins, Terps\",\n          \"Michigan St. Spartans\", \n          \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \n          \"Northwestern Wildcats\", \n          \"Ohio St. Buckeyes\",\n          \"Penn St. Nittany Lions\",\n          \"Purdue Boilermakers\", \n          \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\", \n          \"Wisconsin Badgers\")\n  )\n\ncarohaleyy &lt;- gamesstarted |&gt; \n  filter(Player\n  %in% c(\"Caroline Flynn\",\n         \"Haley Hanson\"\n         ))\n\nFlynn &lt;- c(\"Goals\"=5, \"ShAtt\"=35)\nHanson &lt;- c(\"Goals\"=3, \"ShAtt\"=22, 15)\nBigTenAvg &lt;- c(\"Goals\"=3, \"ShAtt\"=15, 22)\n\niron(\n waffle(Flynn, \n        rows = 2, \n        title=\"Flynn's Goals and Shot Attempts\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 goal or shot attempt\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        ),\n waffle(Hanson, \n        rows = 2, \n        title=\"Hanson's Goals and Shot Attempts\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 goal or shot attempt\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n        ),\n  waffle(BigTenAvg, \n        rows = 2, \n        title=\"Big Ten Average Goals and Attempts\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 goal or shot attempt\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n        )\n ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlynn’s goal and shot attempts far higher than other players in the Big Ten.

Caroline Flynn is listed right underneath notable players, like retired professionals Jaycie Johnson (Ackerman) and Sydney Miramontez. Caroline Flynn averaged .29 goals and assists per game, followed by Haley Hanson with around .20 goals and assists per game.\nCaroline and Haley were strong competitors and leaders in college athletics, but to list them as some of the best players in the Big Ten is open to interpretation. Caroline retired shortly after her professional debut for Kansas City FC in 2017. Haley is currently looking to win her second NWSL Championship this season."
